SVG Path Color Guide - Based on Step6.py

Current Style Structure:
style="fill:none;fill-opacity:1;fill-rule:nonzero;stroke:#ff0000;stroke-width:7;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-linejoin:round;stroke-miterlimit:10;stroke-dasharray:none;stroke-opacity:1"

To Change Colors:
1. Locate the style string in the code (around line 45)
2. Modify these specific attributes:
   - stroke:#ff0000 (currently red)
   - fill:none (currently transparent)

Common Color Examples:
- Red (current): stroke:#ff0000
- Orange: stroke:#fb7905
- Blue: stroke:#0000ff
- Green: stroke:#00ff00

Important Style Properties to Maintain:
- stroke-width:7
- stroke-linecap:round
- stroke-linejoin:round
- stroke-miterlimit:10
- stroke-dasharray:none
- stroke-opacity:1
- fill-opacity:1
- fill-rule:nonzero

Code Location:
The color is defined in the 'new_path' variable where the merged paths are created.

Example Change:
To change to orange, modify the style string to:
style="fill:none;fill-opacity:1;fill-rule:nonzero;stroke:#fb7905;stroke-width:7;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-linejoin:round;stroke-miterlimit:10;stroke-dasharray:none;stroke-opacity:1"

Note: Keep all other style attributes unchanged to maintain the path's appearance and properties.
