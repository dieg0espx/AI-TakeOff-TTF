    "extracted_text": "The construction project will engage in the usage of 2x2x6 wooden joists. These will be constructed under a slab for supporting it. In reference to one of the main building elements, the dimensions of the slab-band should be a minimum of 4 feet by 18 inches deep, with a spacing of 19.2 inches on center.\n\nAdditionally, these measurements apply to a 113-inch projection specified, designed at an angle of 16 degrees to the wall. As for the other measurements like the 10 feet 6 inches, these represent the quantity for the wood joist reinforcement. The contract involves the main slab having a depth of 8 inches typically used, unless otherwise specified. This marks a safety factor of 150 Pounds per square foot (P.S.F.). Notwithstanding, the slab band has a greater depth reaching 18 inches, with a higher safety factor of 275 P.S.F.\n\nPart of the requirements includes the frames being heavy-duty, 4-foot wide, with a standard bracing of 7 feet. Notably, shoring under the slab will not be typically necessary, unless otherwise marked using 'x' to denote the requirement of a number 2 post shore. The building will use moderately dense fir plywood, which should measure at least 3/4 inches deep, and rank as number 1 quality or better. \n\nAdditionally, the 4X6 wooden joists, which are provided by TTF Scaffolding, are explicitly prohibited from being used for packing or shortening for other purposes. All plans, architectural or structural drawings, should be read together with this layout to avoid missing any important information. The contractor is required to verify all dimensions and elevations before any shipment of equipment and materials to the site. \n\nThe construction site is a commercial apartment complex located at 3625 - 3639 Kingsway Avenue in Vancouver, British Columbia, and the project is under the responsibility of Lalli Investment Inc. The documentation is titled 'Parking Level P11 Suspended Slab Shoring Plan & Details,' drawn by F.T., dated December 1, 2024. Noteworthy is the requirement for an inspection by a registered Professional Engineer (P. Eng) before any concrete pouring activity (48-hour notice is mandatory).",
