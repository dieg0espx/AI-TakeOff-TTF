    "extracted_text": "Let's begin with the specifications for the step slabs. The soffit measures 2 inches thick, with a series of atypically arranged measurements. The general measurements include a series of 4x6 at an angle of 14 degrees, followed by lengths of 16 inches, all at the same angle. It's important to note that the maximum distance between supported slabs should not exceed 8 feet. In terms of vertical measurements, every 3 inches would be equivalent to 2 feet at the position of 6 feet from the ground level. \n\nMoving on to the first-floor suspended slab shoring plan, the scaling system used here is 1 foot equivalent to a 1-inch representation. We have two types of slabs for this plan. The typical slab is 8 inches deep. Under special conditions not stipulated, a 20-inch deep slab band could be used instead. All frames used in this setup should measure 6 feet in height by 4 feet in width under slab and 5 feet in height under slab band. These should be heavy-duty frames supporting 10,000 lbs per leg as shown. It is important to note that unless otherwise specified, no shore is needed under the slab nor slab band. \n\nThe plywood used should be a minimum of 3/4\" Douglas fir #1 or better. The 4x6 wood joists provided by TTF Scaffolding should not be used for packing or otherwise cut short for any other purpose. For more detailed information, consult the F-1 drawing. Prior to concrete pouring, an inspection is crucial and must be performed by the undersigned professional engineer with a prior notice time of no less than 24 hours. \n\nIt's crucial to verify all dimensions and elevations before the equipment is shipped. Under stair shoring setup should start at the lowest elevation and be built up under slops typically. This plan includes a series of 2-2x6 wood joist situated 19.2 inches on center.\n\nAll specifications outlined in the technical drawings must be incorporated not just with construction details but also in alignment with architectural and structural drawings. \n\nThis project, referred to as the First Floor Suspended Slab Shoring Plan and Details, was put together by TTF Scaffolding Co. Ltd, in collaboration with VPL Engineering Ltd. The job was contracted by Karvin Developments LTD for Edwards Street Condos located at 9194 Edwards Street, Chilliwack, B.C. The final technical drawings were prepared on April 10, 2021. For further inquiries or clarifications, you may contact our office at 778 898 5301 or visit our website at www.ttfscaffolding.com.",
